# AGENTS.md

This file is the project entry point for general AI agents.

**You MUST read [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) before any PPT generation task or repo modification.** It owns global execution discipline and points to the route selector; after routing, the selected runtime authority owns its steps, gates, and commands. The rest of this file only points to where related material lives.

## Project Overview

PPT Master turns source material into natively editable DrawingML PPTX. Generate has two mutually exclusive runtimes: Default Strategist → Image_Generator → Executor, and self-contained Quick without separate strategy/confirmation. Beautify selects from explicit Quick intent; Image to PPTX always uses Quick.

**Route selection authority**: [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/routing.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/routing.md) owns the four top-level artifact routes: Generate PPTX, Create Template, Fill Native PPTX, and Enhance Native PPTX. Child workflows, profiles, stages, and governance documents refine one selected route; they are not competing top-level routes.

- Topic-only or fact-insufficient inputs run [`topic-research`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/topic-research.md) inside the selected Generate profile's source intake; facts only, no images.
- Default Generate prepares template candidates internally in Step 3, then confirms the communication contract and free-design/template choice together in Stage 1. Template content stays unread until that confirmation; selected roots are installed before template-aware Stage 2. Quick skips this interaction.
- Raw PPTX template plus new material/topic routes to [`template-fill-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/template-fill-pptx.md), not the SVG pipeline.
- Raw PPTX cannot be consumed as a Generate template workspace; run [`create-template`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md) first and return with the generated workspace root as a Stage-1 candidate. Never add Master/Layout structure directly to an existing PPTX/SVG; generate new structured SVG pages from the workspace.
- Explicit quick/fast or skip-strategy generation may use [`quick-generate`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/quick-generate.md): prepare sources/resources as needed, decide without interaction, omit Strategist/confirmation/spec/lock, hand-author `svg_output/`, pass its lockless final checker, and export.
- Recorded, self-running, or video-directed Generate work conditionally loads [`video-design`](skills/ppt-master/references/video-design.md) inside the selected Default or explicit Quick runtime before page planning. It changes scene, script, and motion design—not the runtime/profile or artifact route.
- PPTX beautify is a strict 1:1 Generate [`profile`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/beautify-pptx.md), not a separate route. Explicit Quick intent uses the Quick runtime; otherwise it uses Default. Any split/merge/drop/reorder disables Beautify and returns to ordinary Generate in the selected runtime.
- Page-image reconstruction uses the Codex-supported, Quick-only [`image-to-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/image-to-pptx.md) profile. Normalize input page frames; one frame becomes one slide. Restore text natively, reconstruct low-resolution graphics without changing identity, and derive registered clean-base/scene layers. Padded-bbox-disjoint objects may share a generated plate and become independent crops. Never use a full-slide screenshot skin. Other hosts are unsupported.
- Finished PPTX native enhancement uses [`native-enhance-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/native-enhance-pptx.md) and must not enter SVG regeneration.
- [`visual-review`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/visual-review.md), [`customize-animations`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/customize-animations.md), and [`generate-audio`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/generate-audio.md) are supporting stages; their trigger rules remain explicit/conditional.

## Execution Requirements

- For any `brand`, `style`, `layout`, or `deck` workspace creation from PPTX/SVG, images/PDFs, documents/websites, brand assets, direct text, or mixed references, enter [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md); it keeps the fixed Create Template name and dispatches exactly one of [`create-brand`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-brand.md), [`create-style`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-style.md), [`create-layout`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-layout.md), or [`create-deck`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-deck.md).
- Always-on SVG constraints and shared visual-quality defaults live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards-core.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards-core.md). Default and Quick Generate always load [`svg-effects.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/svg-effects.md); other routes load it, [`native-data-interface.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/native-data-interface.md), and [`pptx-structure-interface.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/pptx-structure-interface.md) only when their documented execution triggers apply.
- Canvas choices live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md).
- Icon library details live in [`skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md`](skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md).

## Required Conventions

- **Repo-wide style rules** — when editing prompt files under [`skills/ppt-master/references/`](skills/ppt-master/references/), Python under [`skills/ppt-master/scripts/`](skills/ppt-master/scripts/), or any other code/prose in the repo, follow the matching style rule in [`docs/rules/`](docs/rules/).
- **Prompt decision ownership** — follow [`docs/rules/prompt-style.md`](docs/rules/prompt-style.md) §4.1. Default Strategist prepares project-local resources and Executor realizes them; Quick's current agent decides and prepares before SVG authoring. This is not downstream acquisition. Every project icon is prepared material; `icons.inventory` indexes the default plan's curated bundled pool, not page usage or an execution whitelist. Sounds follow [`animations.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/animations.md) §2.2.
- **Markdown language consistency** — follow [`docs/rules/language.md`](docs/rules/language.md): one language per file, mirroring the siblings in that directory; a non-English string may appear in an English file only as quoted content (user trigger text, sample values, rendered labels, proper nouns), never as the wording of a rule; never hard-code which language the model replies in. Chat replies are unaffected.

## Compatibility Boundary

- This repository is a workflow/skill package, not an app or service scaffold.
- Do NOT assume generic-project conventions like `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, or mandatory branch setup unless the user explicitly requests them.
- On conflict with a generic coding skill, prioritize [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) inside this repository.

## Command Quick Reference

Convenience summary only — route selection starts in [`SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md). Image to PPTX always uses [`quick-generate.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/quick-generate.md); Beautify uses it only when Quick is explicit, otherwise [`generate-pptx.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/generate-pptx.md).
